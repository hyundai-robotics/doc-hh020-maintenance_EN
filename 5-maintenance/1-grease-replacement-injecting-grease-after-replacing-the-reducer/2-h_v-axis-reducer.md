■	Grease Replacement

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Keep the H axis arm vertically and the V axis horizontally.
</li><br>
    <li>Remove the grease outlet plug.
</li><br>
    <li>Inject the grease into the grease inlet using a grease gun.

<p>

-   Grease type : VIGO GREASE RE0<p>
-	Amount of grease

       H-AXIS : 765cc(688g)<br>
       V-AXIS : 534c(480g)

-	Grease type : RV GREASE LB00<p>
-	Amount of grease

       H-AXIS : 765cc(665g)<br>

</li><br>
    <li>
The grease replacement is complete when new grease appears in the outlet port. The new grease can be distinguished from the old one by color.
</li><br>
    <li>Move the H-Axis for a few minutes to eject the old grease and then add grease until the new grease appears in the outlet port.
</li><br>
    <li>Clean the outlet with cloth and release over-injected grease.

①	Place a vinyl bag on the grease outlet.

②	Commission the Axis-H/V, at ±45° for 1.5 hours at 50% speed.

③	Remove the vinyl bag.
</li><br>
    <li>Clean the greased around the outlet and assemble the seal-taped plug into its original state.
</li>
</ol>

■	Injecting grease after replacing the reducer
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>
Prepare the grease nipple A-PT1/4.
</li><br>
    <li>Remove the plug G1/4 of the grease inlet, and fasten the grease nipple A-PT1/4.

    <li>The grease replacement is complete when new grease appears in the outlet port. 
</li><br>
    <li>Discharge excessively fueled grease and residual pressure. (Refer to the discharge procedure below.)
</li><br>
    <li>Remove the grease nipple of the inlet, and assemble the inlet plug.
</li>
</ol>

<br>

■	Procedure in discharging excessively fueled grease and residual pressure after grease replacement and injection
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>Attach a grease receiver or a hose to the grease outlet to prevent contamination from discharged grease.
</li><br>
    <li>Operate it within a range without surrounding and interference under the following conditions.
    
①	Operation angle : H-axis 90°or more, V-axis 70°or more 

②	Operation speed : 50%

③	Operation time : 1.5 hours or more

④	Work so that the injected amount and the discharged amount are the same. If the discharged amount is less, the residual amount needs to be discharged through the inlet.
</li><br>
    <li>Wipe the outlet port with a cloth and attach the plug.
    </li>
</ol>
