</li><br>
    <li>Clean the outlet with cloth and release over-injected grease.

①	Place a vinyl bag on the grease outlet.

②	Commission the Axis-S at ±45° for 1.5 hours at 50% speed.

③	Remove the vinyl bag.
</li><br>
    <li>Clean the greased around the outlet and assemble the seal-taped plug into its original state.

■	Procedure in discharging excessively fueled grease and residual pressure after grease replacement and injection
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" start="1">
    <li>Attach a grease receiver or a hose to the grease outlet to prevent contamination from discharged grease.
</li><br>
    <li>Operate it within a range without surrounding and interference under the following conditions.

①	Operation angle : 80°or more 

②	Operation speed : 50%

③	Operation time : 1.5 hours or more

④	Work so that the injected amount and the discharged amount are the same. If the discharged amount is less, the residual amount needs to be discharged through the inlet.
</li><br>
    <li>Wipe the outlet port with a cloth and attach the plug.
