# 3.5.2. Installation the Robot Manipulator

The main body of the robot must be fixated firmly with 4 M16 bolts. All 4 bolts must be used.

*	Bolt 		 : M16(12.9) HEX SOCKET HEAD BOLT
*	Washer 		 : Spring washer, plain washer
*	Connection torque: 293Nm

The base floor where the robot will be installed must be designed to have hardness to minimize the dynamic effect of the robot. 

When installing the robot on the concrete floor with thickness of 200mm or more, repair any uneven areas or cracks and fixate the mounting plate with M20 anchor bolts. And when installing the robot on the concrete floor with thickness of less than 200mm, make sure to review prior to the installation as it requires base construction.
